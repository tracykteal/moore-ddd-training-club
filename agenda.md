## Moore DDD Training Club meeting Agenda

### October 10-11, 2015

General goals of the Moore DDD Training Club is to get people who are interested in data-driven discovery training efforts together to discover what resources are available, how we can help each other with training and make training efforts available to others. Mainly we wanted to give people an awareness of what others were working on
or thinking about in the training space and start some discussions about how
we could work together more effectively than working on our own. Agenda developed with this in mind.

- 4:00 Unconference style - based on intros, propose and select topics for small group breakout discussions; write up notes as issues, documents or somewhere in github
- 5:30 Wrap up - update your notes so others can see generally what you discussed
- 6:00 Dinner/refreshments at Titus and Tracy’s house.  
House is about 2 miles from meeting room, so walking distance, or we’ll arrange rides


#### Sunday, October 11th

Potentially a morning run/walk/hike if there’s interest

- 9:00 Read people’s notes from the previous day on their breakouts. See what ones want to continue or if groups want to reconfigure or join forces.
- 9:15 General discussion - how could we go about training people from each other’s labs in tools or techniques if there is interest and overlap
- 9:45 Adaptable - one idea presented below
- 9:45 Small group breakouts  (Acquire coffee sometime during breakout)
- 11:00 Lightning collaborative proposal pitches - based on small group breakouts and other discussions, are there any things people want to pitch doing together? A variant of ‘one ask, one offer’. Are there things we can do together better than separately? Synergies!
- 12:00 Lunch
- 1:30   Collaborative proposal group breakouts if people are still around

People are leaving somewhere in the afternoon

#### Outcomes:
- notes on GitHub from breakouts, so we can capture conversations and ideas (we might not be able to do everything, but maybe there are others who are interested or can help) Open!
- ideas about discoverability and awareness of training efforts
- a strategy for being able to do Moore investigator cross-lab training
